## 0. About and Links
  Growing up in the 80's and 90's I loved console RPG's that used sprites and told epic stories. I have made some amatuer RPG Maker games over the years, and something I have always wanted to do it gain a deeper understanding of how those games work. I created this project so I could teach myself how to animate sprites, learn how to implement good collision dectetion and tell a short and fun story. Feel free to enjoy!
